# Diabetes Predection Model

A pre-trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, saved using the pickle module, is used to make predictions on whether a person is diabetic based on input features.

The pickle.load function loads the saved SVM model, which was trained previously for diabetes prediction and stored in the file diabetes_trained_model.sav.

The model makes a prediction on the reshaped input data. The predict method returns a value (either 0 or 1), where 0 typically indicates "non-diabetic" and 1 indicates "diabetic".

The model used in this code is an SVM (Support Vector Machine), a supervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for classification tasks like predicting diabetes in this case. The SVM was trained on diabetes-related data, and the trained model was saved using pickle for future predictions.




## Deployment

I developed and deployed a machine learning model for diabetes prediction in a web application using Streamlit, a popular Python framework for building data-driven applications with ease. The model, trained using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), was integrated into the web app to allow users to input relevant health parameters and receive predictions on whether they are likely to have diabetes.


#### Real-time Predictions: 
Upon submitting the data, the web app uses the model to predict if the user is diabetic or not, displaying the result instantly in a clear and interpretable manner.

#### Scalability and Accessibility: 
Streamlit's simplicity allowed for the rapid deployment of the web app, making the predictive model easily accessible through a browser.

- This solution enables users to interact with the machine learning model in real-time, providing a practical demonstration of AI in healthcare.
